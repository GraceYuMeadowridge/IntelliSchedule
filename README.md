# IntelliSchedule

### What we will submit:

- 4-minute video (problem-solution, uniqueness, how it's built, demo)
- Devpost Description
- Pitch Deck (Google Slides)
- Wireframes/mockups
- Link to Github Repo (optional for Idea Track)
- CAD/blueprints for physical device (optional)

### Criteria (General Criteria + Idea Track):

- Problem Solving
  - How large is the problem that the team has identified?
  - How large is the market in which the problem is based?
  - Is the problem a unique one that existing products do not already solve?
- Solution
  - How well does the project solve the problem that has been identified?
  - Is the solution well thought out, well executed and functional?
  - Does the solution incorporate a new way of thinking about the problem and a unique set of features that is not found elsewhere?
  - Would a consumer actually use the product?
- Solution Complexity
  - If the product is built using code, how complex is it for the product to be built? If the product was only designed, how complex are the user flows and the application itself?
  - Does the solution show evidence that the team has challenged themselves in order to create the product?
  - Does the solution incorporate best practices in terms of security and good user experience?
- User Interface and Aesthetics
  - Does a proper user interface exist?
  - How well is the user interface designed?
  - Are the aesthetics of the project pleasing?
- Presentation and Demo
  - Does the pitch describe the problem, solution and features of the project?
  - How well does the team communicate their idea? Are proper communication skills evident?
  - Are all the features of the project clearly presented?
  - Is a demo link provided? If so, add +1 to the score
- Does the project satisfy industry-level UI and UX standards?
- Would a user have difficulty using or understanding the product with its current designs?
- Has the team described their workflow in getting to this idea and has their pitch clearly demonstrated how their idea could evolve in the future?
